# Clean Starter

Generate a Clean Architecture Structure Starter with dependency injection.

## Requirements

Make sure you have ```get_it``` added in your ```pubspec.yaml``` file

## Usage ðŸš€

This will overwrite your ```main.dart``` file because it will initialize ```di``` (dependency injection)

```sh
mason make clean_starter --on-conflict overwrite
```

run the following if you want to skip ```main.dart``` file

```sh
mason make clean_starter --on-conflict skip
```
